  I've long been passionate about issues of user privacy, so I jumped at the
  recent opportunity to spin up a new “Trust Experience” team in Google
  Search. Our team is responsible for aspects of the search user interfaces
  that affects user trust. (BTW, I'm hiring.)
</p>

<p>
  I am excited about finally contributing to addressing what I think is the
  most difficult problem of privacy: how to give an average user
  transparency
  and meaningful control of their data, given the systems that manipulate
  the
  data are huge, complex, and opaque to almost everyone.
</p>

<p>
  I have a hypothesis that the key to solving this problem is to create a
  new
  kind of visualizable model that is a projection of how a user's data is
  being used.

  Of course, our team has some mundane work to do too, including making sure
  the cookie consent dialogs meet all the regulatory mandates in different
  jurisdictions and are not too annoying.
