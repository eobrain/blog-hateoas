    <p>
      I've long been passionate about issues of user privacy, so I jumped at the
      recent opportunity to spin up a new “Trust Experience” team in Google
      Search. Our team is responsible for aspects of the search user interfaces
      that affects user trust. (BTW, I'm hiring.)
    </p>

    <p>
      I am excited about finally contributing to addressing what I think is the
      most difficult problem of privacy: how to give an average user
      transparency
      and meaningful control of their data, given the systems that manipulate
      the
      data are huge, complex, and opaque to almost everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a hypothesis that the key to solving this problem is to create a
      new
      kind of visualizable model that is a projection of how a user's data is
      being used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, our team has some mundane work to do too, including making sure
      the cookie consent dialogs meet all the regulatory mandates in different
      jurisdictions and are not too annoying.
