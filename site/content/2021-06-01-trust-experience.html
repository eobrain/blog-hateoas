<p>I've long been passionate about issues of user privacy, so I jumped at the
recent opportunity to spin up a new "Trust Experience" team in Google Search.
Our team is responsible for aspects of the search user interfaces that affect
user trust. (BTW, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/eob/status/1394757183594647552">hiring</a>.) </p>
<p>I am  excited about finally contributing to addressing what I think is the most
difficult problem of privacy: how to give an average user transparency and
meaningful control of their data, given the systems that manipulate the data are
huge, complex, and opaque to almost everone.</p>
<p>I have a hypothesis that the key to solving this problem is to create a new kind
of visualizable model that is a projection of how a user's data is being used.</p>
<p>Of course, our team has some mundane work to do too, including making sure the
cookie consent dialogs meet all the regulatory mandates in different
jurisdictions, and are not too <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanBurkeShow/status/1359488600170258432">annoying</a>.</p>
